			<h3 class="history">History of the Club</h3>
				<p class="history">First set up in 1898, the club has had a long history. Its first captain A H Leech, a mining engineer, highlighted the clubs close connection with the town. Alongside him was the clubs first president Sir Francis Sharp Powell, a member of the Wigan parliment. The club is built on the grounds of Arley Hall, an abbey that dates back to the 12th century, some old parts still remain at the back of the now club house. However what is most memorable about the grounds is the moat and club house at the center. Rebuilt in 1767 the club house is what Wigan Golf Club is famous for, with its moat which houses the two balck swans and kingfishers.

				<p class="john">If one was to ask a member at the club who the most famous member was, then the answer would be simple "John Wild". Captain from 1976-77 and Lancashire Union president in 1985 as well as President of the English Golf Union in the same year, John Wild is famous for his dedication towards Wigan and how he made it his goal to spread word about the club. One of his most famous achivements being that he was able to arrange Prince Andrew to visit the club."
